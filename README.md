The data was collected on April 19th 2020.

The COVID-19 Tracking Progress was used to collect all COVID related data. This includes:
State Totals: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vRwAqp96T9sYYq2-i7Tj0pvTf6XVHjDSMIKBdZHXiCGGdNC0ypEU9NbngS8mxea55JuCFuua1MUeOj5/pubhtml#
County Totals. 
County Totals were done by going to each individual states website on the COVID-19 Tracking progress and collecting the data from that site. The page with all the sources was: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/2/d/e/2PACX-1vRwAqp96T9sYYq2-i7Tj0pvTf6XVHjDSMIKBdZHXiCGGdNC0ypEU9NbngS8mxea55JuCFuua1MUeOj5/pubhtml#
Due to the nature of how the county totals were collected, there might be some discrepancies between the state and county sums. This includes unknown county data as well.
